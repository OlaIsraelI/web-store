                <p>Back-End Development: Building scalable and secure server-side applications using Node.js, Express, Python (Django/Flask), and PHP. I design databases with a focus on efficiency, whether using SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) solutions.</p>
                <p>Full Stack Projects: Integrating front-end and back-end technologies to develop complete web applications. I am adept at managing the full development lifecycle, from conceptualization to deployment, ensuring that every project is optimized for performance and security.</p>
